//  the wolfman game //

The game is set during the Spanish Inquisition.  After several strange several incidents in the
area, the public have blamed you and deemed you a werewolf.  Although there is glaring evidence
that proves you've had nothing to do with these incidents, the public are still determined to put
you down.

Your believers have a boat somewhere in the South of Spain and they are waiting for you.  Your
objective is to get to the south and get to the boat. However, if you arrive there as a werewolf,
you will not be accepted.
