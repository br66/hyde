take information from file
load it into variables from code

is every single frame a new variables
can i simply load the entire array into a variable?
animation_t->frames = json_object_get(data, "frames"); ???
is it possible to print entire array at once instead of for loop?

how do i change its name based on its unique data?
return an entire animation set
instantiate new animSet_s
set variables in animSet to designated data
data may have to be translated/converted
return finished animation set

for simplifying getting animSets
if player is in the parameter,
specifically go to <file>
if parameter equals player get player.json, bomber gets bomber.json, kid get kid.json

decrement the max number for individual animation sets based on whether the spots in the array are being used

getAnimSet(data that I want, object I want to give the data to)





HUD is next, 0 health is detected;
make a sprite list for creating needed and removing old sprites

get rid of all name inconsistencies
need to check for memory leaks
need to free playerAnim


creating system for sprite

void InitSpriteList()
{
  int x;
  NumSprites = 0;
  memset(SpriteList,0,sizeof(Sprite) * MaxSprites);
  for(x = 0;x < MaxSprites;x++)SpriteList[x].image = NULL;
}

sprite and animation set must be combined into sprite_t
sprite hold the image and its animations, saves the filename,
the frames per line

check if sprite is already loaded, strcmp the filename from the parameter
with the filename from all the loaded sprites in the array

commit before significant changes to sprite implementation

before i commit
multiple animations make an animation set
animation sets are owned by sprite
sprites are owned by entity

after commit
when game starts, player->animSet = getAnimSet
showFrame should not have to be changed
change all references to sdl_surface * sprite to sprite_t * sprite
