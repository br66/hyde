take information from file
load it into variables from code

is every single frame a new variables
can i simply load the entire array into a variable?
animation_t->frames = json_object_get(data, "frames"); ???
is it possible to print entire array at once instead of for loop?

return an entire animation set
instantiate new animSet_s
set variables in animSet to designated data
return finished animation set

for simplifying getting animSets
if player is in the parameter,
specifically go to <file>
